Sanskar Singh - Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, a fully responsive, single-page application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a Full Stack Developer and Software Engineer.

The website has a futuristic, sleek, and minimal aesthetic, featuring a dark/light mode toggle and cinematic scroll-based animations.
